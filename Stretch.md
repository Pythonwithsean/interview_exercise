Currently We want to add tags to a conversation so we can help users find things that they are interested in

So first thing solution that comes to my mind allowing a user to a slice of strings for the tags and then we have a hashmap to store the tags as a key in the hashmap and then have an array of message ids that relate to that specific
for tag

and then we can store the key and value in a Database like Reddis or MongoDB for storage
